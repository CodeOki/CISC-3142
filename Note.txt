*This text-based file thats saved as "Note.txt" will be listing all the software, version, link to download, and documentation

I would be mainly using cocalc.com for my local development environment
cocalc.com is a virtual online workspace that allows many different types of systems/programs to run remotely within a created project on a web browser
I am using CoCalc Linux Terminal which is basically a Linux Terminal that is running in a project I created on the website
Everything will be backed up and synchronized including files as long its in the project itself created within the online workspace
